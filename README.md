# custom_conf
WIP for a solution for config files for my other projects.\
Features (not everything implemented yet)
- custom types (e.g. Numbers between specific bounds, enums, etc.)
- values as instance variables, so IDEs are able to find usages/etc.
- optional/required configuration keys (not yet implemented)
- default values
